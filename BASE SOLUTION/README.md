# Base Solution

To run the PROPOSER, after cloning the repository run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, create a ```.env``` file with the following keys:
```
API_KEY=<Your API Key>
BASE_URL=<OpenAI Compatible Base URL: Omit if using openai models directly>
MODEL=<Proposer Model Name>
REVIEWERS=<Multi Agent Model Names, space seperated>
META_REVIEWER=<Single Agent Model Name - Acts as Metaverifier>
```

Example:
```
API_KEY=api-key
BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
MODEL=microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus
REVIEWERS=qwen2.5:3b llama3.2:1b
META_REVIEWER=qwen3:32b
```

Finally, run PROPOSER.py
```
python PROPOSER.py
```

# Self Refinement

After running PROPOSER, run PROPOSER_AFTER_SELF_REFINEMENT.py
```
python PROPOSER_AFTER_SELF_REFINEMENT.py
```

# Single Agent Review

After running PROPOSER, run SINGLE_AGENT_REVIEWER.py
```
python SINGLE_AGENT_REVIEWER.py
```

Then run PROPOSER_WITH_SINGLE_AGENT_REVIEW.py
```
python PROPOSER_WITH_SINGLE_AGENT_REVIEW.py
```

# Multi Agent Review

After running PROPOSER, run REVIEWERS.py
```
python REVIEWERS.py
```

Then run META_REVIEWER.py

# Other information

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Since these codes make API calls to AI agents, there are many possibilities for error. These codes will prompt the user to run the code again in that case.
> These errors will not damage the already successful responses. 
> You can stop any of the codes while they are running and rerun the code later. Progress will not be lost.

> [!TIP]
> Each code has a MAX_TIME_LIMIT variable at the top. In case of multiple TIMEOUT errors, increase the value of this variable.
