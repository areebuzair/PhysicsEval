# EVALUATIONS

Use this code to evaluate the solutions generated in ```BASE SOLUTION```. We use gemini-2.5-pro, so you will need a Google Gemini API key.

## Step 1:

Create a text file named ```api_keys.txt```. Paste your API key into this file. You can paste multiple API keys into this file (one in each line).

## Step 2:

Copy the files generated in ```../BASE SOLUTION/SOLUTIONS``` into this directory.

## Step 3:

Run ```eval_ollama.py```
```
python eval_ollama.py
```

Your evaluation should be ready in a few hours!
